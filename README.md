# Apache Spark Deep Learning Recipes [Video]
This is the code repository for [Apache Spark Deep Learning Recipes [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/apache-spark-deep-learning-recipes-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789955521), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
With deep learning gaining rapid mainstream adoption in modern-day industries, organizations are looking for ways to unite popular big data tools with highly efficient deep learning libraries. As a result, this will help deep learning models train with higher efficiency and speed. 
This video course start offs by explaining the process of developing a neural network from scratch using deep learning libraries such as Tensorflow or Keras. It focuses on the pain points of convolution neural networks. We’ll predict fire department calls with Spark ML and Apple stock market cost with LSTM. We’ll walk you through the steps to classify chatbot conversation data for escalation.
